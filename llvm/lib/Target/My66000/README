This is a very experimental backend for the My66000 architecture designed
by Mitch Alsup.
Lots of things do not work yet, see the ToDo list below.

Use the normal LLVM build process with the added cmake flag
  -DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="My66000"


Usage Restrictions:
Must use --frame-pointer=none.

********
* ToDo *
********

* Implement floating point.  There is not a separate register set for
  floating point.

* Implement frame pointer.

* Fix tail calls so they work.

* Implement predicated instruction sequences.

* Produce more compact jump tables.

* Compute correct instruction sizes for variable length instructions.

* Implement code models:
  small - all code fits in 28 bits
  large - all external jumps must be 64 bits.

* Implement ELF output.  This could be a lot of work.

* Enable clang support.

* Enable lld support.  (Need ELF machine code assignment.)
